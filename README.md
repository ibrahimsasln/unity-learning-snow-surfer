# Snow Surfer Game

This is the second 2D game project from the GameDev.tv team’s Udemy course.

I followed the tutorial videos and did the small challenge parts in each lesson.  
When I got stuck, I looked things up and tried my own solutions, so I could practice and understand the topics better.

## How to Play
- **Accelerate:** `W` or `Up Arrow`
- **Balance / Rotate:** `A/D` or `Left/Right Arrow`

### Powerups
- **Boost powerup:** makes you go faster (accelerating feels stronger while it’s active).
- **Torque powerup:** increases rotation speed, so it’s easier to control the character and do flips.

### Scoring & Goal
- **Flips:** each flip gives **+100 points**.
- **Crash:** if your character’s **head hits the ground**, the game restarts.
- **Goal:** reach the **finish flag** with the **highest score** you can.

## Topics I practiced and learned
- Sprite Shapes
- Edge Colliders and Surface Effector 2D
- Cinemachine follow camera
- Unity Input System (WASD or arrow keys)
- Collisions / triggers (finish line, crash detector)
- Particles (stop in air, different effect on head hit)
- UI (fonts, buttons, layout)
- ScriptableObjects (powerups that change torque or speed)
- Timer (deltaTime)
- Character select button

## Notes
This is a learning project (tutorial-based).
