# Snow Surfer Game

This is the second game project from the GameDev.tv team’s Udemy course.

I followed the tutorial videos and did the small challenge parts in each lesson.  
When I got stuck, I looked things up and tried my own solutions, so I could practice and understand the topics better.

## Topics I practiced and learned
- Sprite Shapes
- Edge Colliders and Surface Effector 2D
- Cinemachine follow camera
- Unity Input System (WASD or arrow keys)
- Collisions / triggers (finish line, crash detector)
- Particles (stop in air, different effect on head hit)
- UI (fonts, buttons, layout)
- ScriptableObjects (powerups that change torque or speed)
- Timer (deltaTime)
- Character select button

## Notes
This is a learning project (tutorial-based).
