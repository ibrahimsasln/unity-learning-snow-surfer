# Snow Surfer (GameDev.tv)

This is the second game project from the GameDev.tv team’s Udemy course.

I followed the tutorial videos and also did the small challenge parts in each lesson.  
When I got stuck, I searched and tried my own solutions, so I could practice and understand the topics better.

## Topics I practiced and Learned
- Sprite Shapes
- Edge Colliders & Surface Effector 2D
- Cinemachine follow camera
- Unity Input System
- Collisions / triggers (finish line, crash detector)
- Particles
- UI (fonts, buttons, layout)
- ScriptableObjects (powerups)
- Timer

## Notes
This is a learning project (tutorial-based).
